# A Jobs Listing Website

This is a project aiming to create a job-listing website with jobs recommending function for each user. The basic functionalities of the website are done while the jobs recommending function is still in progress. Some of the functions of this website are:
1. A job board for users to view all the available jobs.
2. A form for employers to easily add jobs to the website.
3. A search function for users to search for the jobs they are interested in.

This application is deployed on heroku which can be access through this [link](https://jobslisting.herokuapp.com/)

## To-Do
1. Implement pagination to separate the jobs into different pages.
2. Implement a jobs recommendation model for each users.
3. Testing git flow
